------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. TYPES OF HAIR LOSS (ALOPECIA)

Hair loss, hair thinning, baldness, and excessive shedding can occur in different forms. Identifying the type is critical for effective treatment.

### A. Androgenetic Alopecia (Pattern Baldness, Genetic Hair Loss, DHT-Related Hair Thinning)

Definition:
Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss. It is genetic and hormone-related, primarily linked to DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which shrinks hair follicles over time.

Causes:
- Genetic predisposition
- Hormonal sensitivity to DHT
- Family history of baldness

Male Pattern Baldness (Norwood Scale):

Stage 1:
Minimal or no visible recession.

Stage 2:
Mild recession at temples (M-shaped hairline).

Stage 3:
Deep temple recession and thinning at the vertex (crown).

Stage 4–7:
Progressive crown balding leading to horseshoe pattern (hair remains on sides and back).

Female Pattern Hair Loss (Ludwig Scale):

Stage 1:
Diffuse thinning on top of head. Hairline remains intact.

Stage 2:
Widening of the center part line. Increased scalp visibility.

Stage 3:
Significant thinning at crown. See-through scalp.

Keywords:
pattern baldness, receding hairline, crown thinning, DHT hair loss, hormonal hair thinning

------------------------------------------------------------

### B. Telogen Effluvium (Stress-Induced Hair Loss, Temporary Hair Shedding)

Definition:
Telogen effluvium is temporary diffuse hair shedding caused by physiological or emotional shock.

Common Triggers:
- Severe stress
- Illness or infection
- Surgery
- Childbirth
- Crash dieting
- High fever

Timeline:
Hair shedding usually begins 2–3 months after the triggering event.

Symptoms:
- Sudden excessive shedding
- Handfuls of hair during washing or combing
- Diffuse thinning across scalp

Duration:
Typically resolves within 6–9 months if trigger is removed.

Keywords:
temporary hair loss, stress hair fall, diffuse shedding

------------------------------------------------------------

### C. Alopecia Areata (Autoimmune Hair Loss)

Definition:
An autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks hair follicles.

Symptoms:
- Sudden smooth, round bald patches
- Coin-sized hairless areas
- Possible progression to total scalp hair loss (Alopecia Totalis)

Cause:
Autoimmune dysfunction.

Keywords:
patchy hair loss, autoimmune baldness, circular bald spots

------------------------------------------------------------

### D. Traction Alopecia (Hairstyle-Induced Hair Loss)

Definition:
Hair loss caused by chronic pulling or tension on hair.

Common Causes:
- Tight braids
- Cornrows
- Ponytails
- Extensions

Stages:
1. Redness and scalp irritation
2. Receding hairline
3. Permanent scarring if tension continues

Keywords:
hairline recession, tight hairstyle damage, tension hair loss
